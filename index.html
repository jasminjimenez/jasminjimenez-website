        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Jasmin Jimenez and I am currently attending the University of California, Riverside. I have high passion for helping others, whether it is a human or an animal, in the best way I can. I have always aspired to be a part of the medical community as a professional. I aspire to become an obstetrician and gynecologist, or in a field related to what these medical professionals are trained for. The thought of being a part in the journey of bringing life to the world is absolutely beautiful to me. I have a bit of experience in physical therapy and sports medicine, which was fun, but it was not something I felt extremely passionate about. However, I did gain great knowledge from the time I was a part of a sports medicine team, such as patience, leadership, and communication.<br><br>

        I was in a two- year internship for sports medicine. In this internship, it was my job to attend sports games and help the players, such as focus in on the players movements. Before any practice or games began, my team was to set up a hydration station. This included water bottles with ice and refillable gallons. This setup was typically under a tent with shade and was to be placed in a convenient location for the players. After this was setup, my team and I would tape up the playerâ€™s ankles, wrists, fingers, or any other body part they requested. If needed, they would get aid from our athletic trainer. After wrapping and stretching was done, we were to go out on the field and stand with the players. If any injury were to occur, such as a cut or even a fracture, my team would go out and assist the player while learning from the athletic trainer. We stayed on the field until every practice or game was over. Afterwards, we would go back into the training room where players would get iced or have their tape removed. Once the players were attended, the interns would go back out to the field to clean up the hydration stations. This included disinfecting all bottles and materials used. <br><br>

        My second year in the program I was more of a leader and was focused on training the first- year interns. I was to teach the new interns everything I knew about the program, and ways they could improve. It was definitely a great learning experience, seeing as it improved my leadership skills. After this two- year internship, I gained insight into what profession I wanted to enter. Physical therapy and sports medicine are great fields, but they are not something I was too interested in. I slowly began learning more about the obstetricians and gynecologists and what they focus on in their field. I found myself watching videos on videos, reading articles after articles, and just being extremely invested in the field. I then realized that working with infants, pregnancies, and families was something I knew I wanted to pursue.
